        <pre>
          Authentication is the act of establishing or confirming something (or someone) as authentic, that is, that claims made by or about the subject are true [wikipedia_authentication]. This might involve confirming the identity of a person or assuring that a programmatically made service request is a trusted one.

          From a usability point of view, the best way for a user to authenticate to a service would be blindly trusting his claim of his identity. Since the obvious security concerns render this kind of an approach impractical, the end user must present sufficient credentials in order to gain access. A conventional web service usually maintains a credential database of its own, which leads users to suffer the burden of learning a new password for each service they want to use. There clearly seems to be the need [CITE] for some kind of a single sign on solution where a user can access multiple sites with a single piece of credentials. This problem of shared credentials is illustrated in figure 1 as a blue rectangle (no. 1).

          Another piece of the puzzle is acquiring trust between the service, which a user is wanting to access, and the service, which holds the information about user’s credentials. Let’s call the former service authentication consumer (“AC”) and the latter authentication provider (“AP”). After the user has successfully identified himself with “AP”, he will have an authenticated session with “AP”. However, since “AC” still does not know who the user is, how can the result of the identification process be delivered to “AC” in a secure manner? This problem of gaining trust between authentication parties is illustrated in figure 1 as a red rectangle (no. 2).
